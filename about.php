echo "<h2>About Us</h2><p>From our humble beginnings, we began our market garden in 2005 on our 10 acre property in Armadale, growing a small orchard of fruits crop for the local market.  With dedication and hard work we have expanded our business operations to include a range of vegetables from our friends in market gardens in Baldivis, yangjup and Manjimup that we buy from and sell for our local market
So if you need a little bit of healthy in your life McHealties the fresh healthy tasty food people is the way to go.</p><p>We are a retailer that offers a full range of fresh produce, meat, and dairy. We cut out the middleman and offer our products as wholesale and or purchases as groceries
One of the many advantages of our business is being a centralised location for all your fresh healthy fruit and vegies so no matter what sort of produce you are craving for you will find it and since we are a local market you can pick and choose any produce that you like and when you are feeling a bit lazy want to order in bulk we got our online store which you can order our produce and it gets delivered straight to your door step.
